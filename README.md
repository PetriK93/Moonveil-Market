Auction house has three tabs, "browse", "sell" and "myAuctions". "browse" section will showcase all the items that you want to buy. "sell" section will let you pick an item of your choice to sell from your inventory.
"myAuctions" section contains a list of all the items that you have put up for sale and that you have bidded on.

Project is still under construction..

I used this version of Vite to create and work on the project: "vite": "^5.4.1"

Install the frontend dependencies to the "client" folder:

1. "axios": "^1.7.7",
2. "react": "^18.3.1",
3. "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
4. "react-router-dom": "^6.26.2"

Install the backend dependencies to the "backend" folder:

1. "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
2. "cors": "^2.8.5",
3. "express": "^4.21.0",
4. "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
5. "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",
6. "mysql2": "^3.11.3",
7. "socket.io": "^4.7.5"

Once everything is installed, use cd to navigate to the client folder and then type "npm run dev" into the terminal.

I am still working on the client side, so backend dependencies are subject to change.
